  - title: Situation report Northern Serbia
    content: |-
      Collective Aid and Medical Volunteers International (MVI) have been working on a bi-monthly report about the situation in Northern Serbia that we are excited to share with you. This report focuses on trends in border violence and in Serbian state action in October and November. Its purpose is to contextualize the events of the past two months into a more ongoing narrative and establish a system to continue centralized information monitoring.

name: Serbia
overview: The geolocation of Serbia makes it a region of transit for those travelling
  to Western Europe by land; very few individuals choose to stay and apply for asylum.
  However, the onward journey to Western Europe has been affected by the war in Ukraine,
  [leading to an increase in refugees in Serbia](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41376/refugee-numbers-in-serbia-up-55-on-2021).
  According to the authorities, [6,254 refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants were
  accommodated in governmental centres at the end of August](https://reliefweb.int/report/serbia/unhcr-serbia-update-august-2022),
  [a 24% increase](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/88897) compared to
  the same period of the previous year.

governmentResponse: 'Serbia has 7 Asylum Centres and 12 Reception Centres. To be able
  to stay in an Asylum Centre, one must be [registered with the intent to apply for
  asylum](https://asylumineurope.org/reports/country/serbia/reception-conditions/short-overview-of-the-reception-system/),
  whilst Reception Centres tend to be nearer the border regions and have more flexible
  policies where registration certificates are not required. Under Serbia’s Asylum
  Act, a ‘foreigner’ is not protected by the right to accommodation until they have
  applied for asylum. Serbian government reception facilities are at capacity, resulting
  in poor hygiene conditions and a lack of access to privacy.
