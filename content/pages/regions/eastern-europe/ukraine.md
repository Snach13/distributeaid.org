overview: After Russia invaded Ukraine, many people intended to leave the country
  for one of the bordering states. Long traffic jams in the cities and border regions
  grew as the conflict continued. The chaos intensified as able men [were conscripted
  into the Ukrainian army](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/17/men-fighting-ukraine-separate-families/7077716001/)
  and families had to be separated. Reports of children going missing around the border
  regions are alarmingly high, and human trafficking is a serious concern among the
  organisations working in these areas.

  According to estimates made by the [UN OCHA](https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/ukraine/#cf-7zDXryKIJX1IHL5zJL5YcA) as many as 18 million people across Ukraine are in need of assistance with water, sanitation, and hygiene. In areas with little or no conflict, people are now returning to their homes. [More people are now returning](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/40990/frontex-more-ukrainians-are-returning-than-leaving-the-country) to Ukraine than the number who are leaving. According to Frontex estimations made in early September, around 5.5 million Ukrainians have returned to Ukraine.
