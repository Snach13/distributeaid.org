  description: Beirut has various refugee camps that have existed since the late 1940s.
    Over time they have become established towns/neighbourhoods, [home to thousands
    of Palestinian and Syrian refugees. The largest camp hosts over 100,000 individuals
    and families.](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon) Despite refugee communities
    residing in areas for decades, they are marginalised from the local Lebanese community.
    [Most people do not own Lebanese identity documents, their movements are restricted
    by law, and they cannot access healthcare, own their own land, or work in certain
    professions](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/56cc95484.pdf). As the dire situation
    in Lebanon continues, displaced people are those most affected, often living in
    desperate conditions with little hope of change.

overview: The accumulation of crises in Lebanon, specifically Beirut, has led to enormous
  difficulties across many levels of society. People living in Beirut have been affected
  by the COVID-19 pandemic, electricity shortages, fuel shortages, medicine shortages,
  massive inflation, and the [port blast in August](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/lebanon)
  2020, which left 300,000 people without shelter. These factors have resulted in
  significant numbers of people falling below the poverty line across all parts of
  society. As Beirut hosts an extensive array of Lebanese families, refugees, and
  foreign workers from many backgrounds, these intersecting crises are affecting the
  entire population in Beirut to varying degrees.
