      Below are detailed the full results from the Q4 Needs Assessment 2022.

      In the first section, an overview of all of the results is displayed. Following this, the report is divided into chapters covering specific regions, and then broken down into the following sections for each region:

      1. Population statistics: highlighting population size and migration trends for beneficiaries to service providing grassroots groups
      2. Regional contexts: an overview of the conditions and political situation in that area
      3. Needs: organised by category
      4. Analysis of the results

      1\. Population statistics

      Each participating organisation was asked how many people there are in their region or area who require access to NGO services (this may include refugees, asylum seekers, local houseless people or otherwise disadvantaged people), and how many people access their services (i.e. how many people their individual group serves each month). The average was then taken from the overall population sizes given in each region to give us the ‘People who access NGO services’. When calculating the ‘Number of people served’, the total sum of each group's given number is provided. Comparing these figures enables us to identify gaps in service provision, lack of capacity, or a balanced ratio of NGO’s to beneficiaries. Where the total number of people served is higher than the population in that area, this would suggest that individuals are accessing multiple NGO programmes such as a food distribution and a clothing distribution.

      As NGOs often cannot cover an entire region or country and not every NGO in a region or country filled out the form, an official figure (for example UNHCR or government figures) is provided as well where possible. The number of NGOs who responded to the survey from each region is also provided for the purpose of transparency and to indicate how large the data set is for these figures.

      2\. Regional Contexts

      These sections were researched and written at the end of the previous quarter. Where a sentence or phrase is underlined, you can click through to a linked article where that information was found. You can also use these links for further reading. We hope these sections will provide more contextual background to the circumstances under which grassroots groups work and give a better understanding of why certain items are needed and why everyone should support these groups.

      3\. Needs

      Data collected from those grassroots groups who were involved in the Needs Assessment is displayed in this section. With the use of infographics, the needs of each region (categorised by shelter, baby items, hygiene, and food) can be observed. This data also enables us to identify groups with the same needs locally and work together to procure these needed items. In addition, if a group has items that another group needs within the same region we can connect them to coordinate a local transfer of items.

      4\. Analysis

      Using Sphere Standards, and DA Standards - a comparable standardised system to supplement for needs that we deem basic but are excluded by SPHERE (e.g. toothbrush and toothpaste); we outline what needs are yet to be met. This way, donating groups can run effective and focused aid collection and sourcing for groups collecting and sending aid.

      Benefits

      We hope these results will provide a range of benefits. Being able to publish needs in this manner will provide a better understanding across regions for both aid sending and aid receiving groups. This data will allow for effective and focused aid collection and sourcing for groups that collect and send aid. Using the data in this report, aid collections can be more targeted to a specific region's needs, and the valuable time of donation collection groups can be put to more effective use.

      Finally, we hope this data will show other international organisations and actors where gaps in service provision exist. Grassroots groups do a supreme job at filling these gaps, but it should not be down to civilians to volunteer their time and money to cover basic human needs for disadvantaged populations.
