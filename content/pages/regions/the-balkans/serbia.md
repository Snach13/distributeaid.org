    Balkans tend to be on the move.  Numbers can change substantially from season
    to season due to drastic temperature fluctuations, events in Greece, and other
    reasons.

name: Serbia
overview: The geolocation of Serbia makes it a region of transit for those travelling
  to Western Europe by land; very few individuals choose to stay and apply for asylum.
  However, the onward journey to Western Europe has been affected by the war in Ukraine,
  [leading to an increase in refugees in Serbia](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41376/refugee-numbers-in-serbia-up-55-on-2021).
  According to the authorities, [6,254 refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants were
  accommodated in governmental centres at the end of August](https://reliefweb.int/report/serbia/unhcr-serbia-update-august-2022),
  [a 24% increase](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/88897) compared to
  the same period of the previous year.

governmentResponse: Serbia has 7 Asylum Centres and 12 Reception Centres. To be able
  to stay in an Asylum Centre, one must be [registered with the intent to apply for
  asylum](https://asylumineurope.org/reports/country/serbia/reception-conditions/short-overview-of-the-reception-system/),
  whilst Reception Centres tend to be nearer the border regions and have more flexible
  policies where registration certificates are not required. Under Serbia’s Asylum
  Act, a ‘foreigner’ is not protected by the right to accommodation until they have
  applied for asylum. Serbian government reception facilities are at capacity, resulting
  in poor hygiene conditions and a lack of access to privacy.
