    description: Details the changing conditions in Calais in the five years since
      the Calais jungle was dismantled.

overview: The number of displaced people in Northern France continuously fluctuates
  because the community it hosts is highly transient. Many people reach Northern France
  after months of travel, hoping to cross the English Channel to the UK. [Calais and
  the surrounding area host around 2,000 refugees](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/23/we-all-get-scared-migrants-in-calais-face-fear-determination),
  which will likely increase given the situation in Ukraine. In 2021, [an estimated
  35,382 people attempted to cross the English Channel](https://ecre.org/channel-crossings-soar-in-2021-with-no-legal-routes-fears-for-displaced-following-calais-funding-cut-warm-welcome-illusive-as-resettlement-flops/),
  almost three times as many as in 2020. This is likely due to other routes being
  closed or more challenging to access rather than an overall increase in people seeking
  asylum. Many people making this journey speak English, have family or friends in
  the UK, and/or have been subject to state violence in other countries, deterring
  them from claiming asylum there.
governmentResponse: Displaced people in France face “[inhuman and degrading living
  conditions, as well as police abuse and harassment](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/france).”
  The state sometimes provides emergency shelter during particularly cold weather,
  but almost all migrants are forced to live outside in makeshift camps. Police minimise
  livable areas and frequently seize property. [Human Rights Observers witnessed](https://humanrightsobservers.org/monthly-observations/)
  at least 156 evictions in February alone, and roughly 627 tents and tarps were destroyed
  across Calais and Grande-Synthe. These evictions [regularly subject people to violence
  and police brutality](http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HRO-2020-Annual-Report_All.pdf).
