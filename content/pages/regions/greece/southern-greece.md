  description: Northern Greece and Athens host a combination of people in transit
    and people actively seeking asylum or looking for permanent residence. Once someone
    gains refugee status, they may settle on the mainland and no longer access NGO
    services. Therefore using ‘refugee figures’ in Greece is not particularly insightful.

name: Southern Greece
overview: |-
  The refugee solidarity response in Southern Greece is centred around Athens, which is most commonly where people are relocated from the Aegean Islands after their asylum applications have been processed. Some people seek permanent residence in Athens, while others only stay until arrangements are made for resettlement elsewhere in Europe.  It is common for refugees to live on the streets for periods of time, especially in the summer.

  Athens has many community-led projects, including informal schools, free shops, street food / services, social centres, and squats.  However, warehousing is very expensive in the city, so most larger hubs are located at the edges or in nearby towns.  Refugee camps are located in smaller towns surrounding the city.
