introduction: 'In the north of Greece, displaced people may live on the streets of
  Thessaloniki, in one of the camps located in smaller surrounding towns, may [seek
  permanent residence, or prepare to travel further west](https://www.refugeesintowns.org/thessaloniki).
  Recently, people have been transferred off the Greek islands while their asylum
  cases are still being processed. '
governmentResponse: In both cities and surrounding areas, there are some formal camps,
  as well as people living in squats, apartments, or without any shelter. The camps
  on the mainland are following the trends seen on the Aegean Islands, with [high
  concrete walls being built around them](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32834/greece-migrant-camps-surrounded-by-concrete-walls),
  echoing the detention centre style of accommodation. The living conditions in the
  detention centres are often deplorable.  As the registration procedure gets stricter
  many are told that they are not “vulnerable enough” for shelter, food, or monetary
  aid.

overview: |-
  The refugee solidarity response in Northern Greece is centred around Thessaloniki.  The city hosts a variety of community-run infrastructure, including warehouses, informal schools, social centres, and squats.  The central warehousing hub in Northern Greece is run by [IHA](https://www.iha.help/); it supplies projects in the city as well as camps in the surrounding smaller towns.

  Displaced people in this sub-region may [seek permanent residence or prepare to travel further west](https://www.refugeesintowns.org/thessaloniki).

  description: Northern Greece and Athens host a combination of people in transit
    and people actively seeking asylum or looking for permanent residence. Once someone
    gains refugee status, they may settle on the mainland and no longer access NGO
    services. Therefore using ‘refugee figures’ in Greece is not particularly insightful.
